    <h2>Bio</h2>
    <p>
        Smash Mouth is an American rock band from San Jose, California. The band was formed in 1994, and was originally composed of Steve Harwell (lead vocals), Kevin Coleman (drums), Greg Camp (guitar), and Paul De Lisle (bass). They are known for their songs "Walkin' on the Sun" (1997), "All Star" (1999), etc. 
        The band's first publicity came when a demo of the song "Nervous in the Alley" was played by a San Jose radio station.
        The band's second album, Astro Lounge, was released in 1999 and marked a change in direction, as it had less of the previous ska influence and more of a pop sound.
        Following the band's signing to Universal Records, Smash Mouth released the greatest hits compilation All Star Smash Hits in 2005. 
        On November 1, 2018, Smash Mouth released the single "Unity". It features well known hip-hop artists
